          Troitskiy Bridge is one of the most beautiful bridges in St. Petersburg, located across the Neva River. It connects the central part of the city with the Petrograd side. The bridge was built in 1897-1903 by architect Alexander Pomerantsev and engineer Nikolai Belolyubsky.
The bridge is 582 meters long and 67 meters wide. It consists of five spans, the central one of which is the widest and tallest. The bridge is decorated with cast-iron railings depicting griffins and mermaids, as well as Art Nouveau lanterns.
Granite obelisks with double-headed eagles symbolizing imperial power are installed on both sides of the bridge. On one of the obelisks is the coat of arms of the Russian Empire, and on the other is the coat of arms of St. Petersburg.
