          Bolsheokhtinsky Bridge, also known as the Bridge of Emperor Peter the Great or Bolsheokhtinsky Bridge, was built across the Neva River in 1909-1911. The need for construction arose after the Okhta suburb was annexed to St. Petersburg.
          The bridge project was developed by engineer G. G. Krivoshein and military engineer V. P. Apyshkov. The bridge consists of three spans, with a movable double-wing span in the middle and two coastal spans covered with metal arched trusses.
          The construction of the bridge was carried out under the supervision of a special commission, which included Russian scientists and professors from St. Petersburg. To transport the superstructures, the hulls of old battleships were used, turned into huge pontoons with water ballasting.
          The bridge was opened in 1911 and became the first bridge on the Neva River, providing convenience for navigation. In 1932, the cobblestone pavement was replaced with diabase mosaic and waterproofing was changed on the bridge.

          The bridge structure consists of three spans, the central one of which is movable. The total length of the bridge is 334.75 meters, and the width is 26.5 meters. The stationary superstructures are made in the form of arched double-hinged trusses with a tightening, and the movable span has a double-winged structure. The bridge is designed for vehicles and pedestrians. The roadway of the bridge includes four lanes for cars.
