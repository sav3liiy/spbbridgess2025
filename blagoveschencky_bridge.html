          Blagoveshchensky Bridge is a girder bridge over the Neva River in St. Petersburg, which was built in 1843-1850 by Stanislav Kerbedzya and architect Alexander Bryullov. It was named Blagoveshchenskiy in honor of Blagoveshchenskaya Square, next to which it was located. In 1855, the bridge was renamed Nikolaevsky in honor of Emperor Nicholas I, and in 1918 â€” in honor of Peter Schmidt, the leader of the Sevastopol uprising.
The bridge was completely closed to traffic between September 2005 and May 2006, when a temporary bridge was under construction. During the reconstruction, all vehicles, both pedestrian and motorized, moved over a temporary bridge. The reconstruction was completed on August 15, 2007, after which the bridge was reopened under the name Blagoveshchenskiy.
