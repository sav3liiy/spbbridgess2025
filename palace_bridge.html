          Palace Bridge was built in 1916 and is one of the symbols of St. Petersburg. Its history began in 1727, when the floating St. Isaac's Bridge was installed downstream. In 1850, the first permanent bridge across the Neva River was opened â€” Blagoveshchensky. In 1863, rails were laid across the bridge for horse-drawn cars and trams, which ran on it until 1997.
          The construction of the permanent Palace Bridge began in 1911, but due to various circumstances it was completed only by the end of 1916. The official opening of the bridge took place on December 23, 1916 (January 5, 1917 according to the new style).
          Initially, the bridge was called Republican, but in 1952 it was returned to its historical name. During its history, the bridge has undergone several reconstructions and repairs, including the replacement of railings, lanterns and the installation of granite parapets.

                Palace Bridge is a five-span highway bridge across the Neva River in St. Petersburg. It connects the city center with Vasilyevsky Island and is a drawbridge. The middle span of the bridge is topped with a three-hinged arch, and the remaining spans consist of two continuous structures with through trusses.
The bridge is 260 meters long and 27.7 meters wide. It got its name because of its location near the Palace Embankment and the Winter Palace. A metal deck covered with a concrete layer on top is used for the sidewalks and the roadway of the bridge. The fences on the fixed spans are made of granite, and on the swing span they are made of metal.
