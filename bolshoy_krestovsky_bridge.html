          Bolshoy Krestovsky Bridge was built in 1850 and named after Krestovsky Island. Initially, the bridge had 11 spans, including the central drawbridge with four lifting frames that were lifted manually. Over the course of a century, the bridge has been repaired several times due to wear of wooden structures and breakdowns of supports during ice trips.
By 1950, the wooden crossing was replaced with the capital all-welded metal structure with five spans. The project was developed by engineers P. V. Andreevsky and L. A. Noskov. They provided a movable part with two wings, each of them can be raised by 78 degrees using electric winches. In case of force majeure, the adjustable mechanism was equipped with an additional manual drive.
After the reconstruction, the length of the bridge was 149 meters, the width was more than 25 meters, and the weight of the span metal structures was 815 tons.

          The construction of Bolshoy Krestovsky Bridge includes five spans, the middle of which is movable. The adjustable span is made in the form of a double-winged opening system with a fixed axis of rotation. The stationary superstructures of the bridge are continuous double-span all-welded beams with parallel belts and solid walls. The massive shore supports are made of reinforced concrete and are mounted on a low pile grillage.
