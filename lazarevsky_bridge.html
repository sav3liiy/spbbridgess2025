          Lazarevsky Bridge, spanning the Malaya Nevka River between Petrogradsky and Krestovsky Islands, celebrates a double anniversary. The first ferry is 75 years old and the modern cableâ€”stayed bridge, which was opened on May 23, 2009, is 15 years old.
Until 1952, the bridge was called Koltovsky, along the Koltovskaya embankment, which got its name from the historical district of Koltovskaya Sloboda. In 1952, both the embankment and the bridge were renamed in honor of Admiral Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev (1788-1851), commander of the Black Sea Fleet and the discoverer of Antarctica.

          The old Lazarevsky Bridge has been repaired several times. In 1976, the wooden abutments were replaced with reinforced concrete slabs on metal tubular piles. In 1998, the bridge and tram tracks were repaired. Trams ran along  Lazarevsky Bridge until 2002, after which the crossing became only pedestrian. In 2008-2009, the bridge was completely rebuilt. The new bridge has become a single-span cable-stayed bridge designed for the movement of cars and pedestrians.
