          Liteyny Bridge is the second permanent drawbridge across the Neva River in St. Petersburg. It was built in 1879 and named the bridge of Emperor Alexander II. In 1917, the bridge lost its name and became just a Foundry.
The history of the bridge began in 1786, when the Voskresensky floating Bridge was built on the Neva River. In 1803, the ferry was moved lower, to the Summer Garden, and renamed the Petersburg Bridge. In 1850, a new floating bridge was installed at the same place, which was called the Foundry. In 1865, this bridge was torn down by an ice drift.
The decision to build a permanent bridge was made in 1869. The bridge project was developed by an English firm and received the first prize. However, the commission of the Ministry of Railways made a number of comments, and the development of the project was entrusted to engineer A. E. Struve. Construction of the bridge began in the summer of 1878 and was completed in 1879. The Foundry Bridge became the world's first permanent bridge illuminated by electricity.

          Liteyny Bridge was opened on September 30, 1879. It became the world's first permanent bridge illuminated by electricity. Electric lanterns with "candles" by P. N. Yablochkov were installed on it. Advanced engineering solutions were used in the construction of the bridge. The arches were made not of cast iron, but of welding iron, which made it possible to create a lighter and more economical structure.
          The bridge is a six-span structure with a length of 407.8 meters and a width of 24.4 meters. The size of the central span is 74.55 meters, which is more than 1.5 times larger than the widest span of the Blagoveshchensk Bridge.
