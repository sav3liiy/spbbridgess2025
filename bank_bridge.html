          Bank Bridge is an architectural monument of St. Petersburg, located on the Griboyedov Canal. It was built in 1826 by architect Wilhelm von Tretter and engineer Vasily von Tretter. The bridge consists of two arches connected by a small bridge. Sculptures of mythological characters, the god Mercury and allegories to an Unknown deity, are installed on the lintel. Bank Bridge is pedestrian and serves for pedestrians to cross from one side of the canal to the other.

          The bridge underwent numerous repairs and restorations, as well as structural modifications. In 1949 the wooden cover of the bridge was repaired, and later in 1951–1952 the wooden bearing structure of the bridge was replaced by a metal one. In 1967 and 1988 the gilding of the lions’ wings was renovated. In 1997 the sculptures and handrail lattice were restored. In 2007-2008 Griboyedov Canal Embankment from Kazan Cathedral to the Bank Bridge was renovated. Nowadays the winged lions are the symbol of St. Petersburg University of Economics and Finance. The deck of Bank Bridge is wooden, keeping the structure relatively light, and it has been replaced several times in nearly two centuries. As well as the griffons, Bank Bridge features beautiful cast-iron railings, notable for their ornate, palm-frond design. The original railings were removed at the beginning of the 20th century, and the current railings were installed in 1952, recreated from the original designs.
