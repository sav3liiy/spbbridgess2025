            Anichkov Bridge is one of the most famous bridges in St. Petersburg, located across the Fontanka River. It was built in 1716 and was originally called Nameless. In 1785, the bridge received its current name in honor of engineer-Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Anichkov, who commanded the battalion located next to this place. The current bridge, built in 1841-42 and reconstructed in 1906-08, combines a simple form with some spectacular decorations. As well as its four famous horse sculptures (1849â€“50), the bridge has some of the most celebrated ornate iron railings in Saint Petersburg. The structure is mentioned in the works of Pushkin, Gogol, and Dostoevsky.

            Anichkov Bridge is an architectural monument of St. Petersburg, built in the XVIII century. It consists of three spans and is decorated with four sculptural groups "The Taming of the horse by man", created by the famous sculptor Peter Klodt. The sculptures are made of bronze and symbolize strength and courage.
In the late 18th century the construction of stone embankments and stone bridges began on the banks of the Fontanka River. The first seven stone bridges over the Fontanka River, among which was the Anichkov Bridge, were built by the same standard project. All the bridges were three-span drawbridges with small and elegant towers as decorations. About a hundred years later, traffic in the city, especially on Nevsky Prospekt, has become very intense, streets markedly widened, and narrow drawbridges had to be rebuilt to make them easier to pass. The reconstruction of the Anichkov Bridge was managed by engineer Von Derschau. The bridge was expanded up to 37 meters.
