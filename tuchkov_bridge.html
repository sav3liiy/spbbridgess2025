            Tuchkov Bridge is a drawbridge that connects Bolshoy Prospekt on the Petrogradskaya side with two lines of Vasilyevsky Island (Kadetskaya and Pervaya). It was built in the middle of the XVIII century and was originally called the Nikolsky Bridge. In 1835, the bridge was reconstructed and received a movable central span. In 1965, the bridge was renovated and acquired a modern look.
